                <p>Unless we take action soon, this problem will continue to worsen. While it is hard to estimate exactly what we expect to 
                    happen, <a href="http://www.ghgonline.org/predictions.htm">a range of models</a> have made predcicitons for future conditions. 
                    Within 100 years, CO2 emissions could reach anywhere between 500-900 ppm, temperatures could increase anywhere between 2 and 6 
                    degrees Celsius, and sea levels could rise anywhere between 2 and 4 feet. These changes could have catastrophic implications 
                    including increased occurance of natural disasters, complete flooding of coastal cities, extinction of species, decline of 
                    crop health and the overall end of life as we know it. It is too late to completly halt all of the negative effects of climate change 
                    but it is not too late to help mitigate some of these impacts. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions will have a direct impact 
                    on how damaging these impacts may be.

                <p>While it may be easy to lose hope, there are simple changes you can do to really make a big differnce. 
                    A <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080428120658.htm">study by MIT</a> found that the average 
                    carbon footprint for an average US citizen is 20 metric tons, while the world average is a mere 4 tons. This means our 
                    country is a huge contributer to the problem, but there are many steps you can take to help reduce that. Traveling less 
                    by gasoline powered vehicles, eating local foods, switching to renewable energy sources, composting and reducing water 
                    use are all easy alterations to your daily routine that can scale up and make a big difference. Explore how you can reduce 
                    your Carbon footprint now:
