        <p class="ml-3">As you walk outside in your heavy coat and see the snow fall in late February, it is hard to believe that our 
            planet is actually warming at all. "Global warming" refers to the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/does-global-warming-mean-it%E2%80%99s-warming-everywhere">average annual temperature increase</a>, 
            something that may not be felt the same way in every region due to varied climates. While Earth as a whole is warming, certain 
            regions may even be cooling. When you think about a huge system such as global climate change, you will not be able to understand 
            what is happening when you just think of one pinpoint location. 
        </p>
        <p class="ml-3 mb-0">
            Global climatic patterns are analyzed for long term patterns because they have been relatively constant through Earth's history.
            The problem that we are facing now however, is that each decade has been warmer than the last since 1960, and the most recent 
            three decades have been the warmest we have on record. This unprecedented rate of heating is due to the emission of greenhouse 
            gasses, corresponding with the industrial revolution. Almost every thing we do from driving to work to eating meat to cutting down 
            a tree have a negative impact on our atmosphere. So, while you may be turning up the thermostat more than usual, there is a real 
            global crisis occuring that needs to be addressed before it has the chance to get any worse.

                                    <p>Rates of warming are not constant accross different locations. Certain areas are experiencing warming at a faster rate than 
                                        others, such as the Arctic region which is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/12/18/371438087/arctic-is-warming-twice-as-fast-as-world-average">
                                        warming twice as fast as other regions</a>. This is a result of systems accumulating energy at the poles, causing increased 
                                        warming. Also, as ice melts, it lowers the ability to reflect the sun's energy back into space. This creates a negative 
                                        feedback loop where more warming leads to more melting which in terms leads to more warming.

                                    <p>There is no doubt that greenhouse gas concentrations have been increasing in our atmosphere. Recently, greenhouse gas
                                        concentrations <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/greenhouse-gas-concentrations-surge-new-record">reached 
                                        the highest amount in the last 800,000 years</a>. These greenhouse gas concentrations are altered slightly by climatic shifts 
                                        such as El Nino and La Nina years, but the clear general trend is a dramatic rise in these concentrations. Greenhouse gases 
                                        consist mainly of Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide. This huge surge in greenhouse gas concentrations is largely a 
                                        result of human-induced factors such as population increase, agriculture, deforestation, industrialization and fossil fuel 
                                        emssions. While natural process remove some greenhouse gases from the planet, our current rate of emissions far exceeds
                                        any rate of removal. Since the liftime of emissions in the atmosphere is increadibly long, we are on track for a devestating 
                                        amount of warming.

                                         While that may not seem like much, over two thirds of this increase has occured in the last 50 years

                                        As the temperature of water increases, the water expands. About half of sea level rise to this point is 
                                        an effect of this thermal expansison. The rest comes from ice melting in the form of glaciers and land ice. 
                                        This is a real cause for concern becuase in the United States, almost 40 percent of the population lives in 
                                        coastal regions that are in severe danger of the erosion, flooding and storm events that accompany sea level rise.

                                    <p>Unless we take action soon, this problem will continue to worsen. While it is hard to estimate exactly what we expect to 
                                        happen, <a href="http://www.ghgonline.org/predictions.htm">a range of models</a> have made predcicitons for future conditions. 
                                        Within 100 years, CO2 emissions could reach anywhere between 500-900 ppm, temperatures could increase anywhere between 2 and 6 
                                        degrees Celsius, and sea levels could rise anywhere between 2 and 4 feet. These changes could have catastrophic implications 
                                        including increased occurance of natural disasters, complete flooding of coastal cities, extinction of species, decline of 
                                        crop health and the overall end of life as we know it. It is too late to completly halt all of the negative effects of climate change 
                                        but it is not too late to help mitigate some of these impacts. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions will have a direct impact
